# NLP-sentiment-analysis with Pytorch

# Goal
The primary goal of this project is to build and evaluate a machine learning model that can classify text data into multiple sentiment categories (positive, neutral, and negative) using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. Dataset taken from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Sp1786/multiclass-sentiment-analysis-dataset).

# Tools & Libraries

- Python: Primary programming language.
- Jupyter Notebook: Interactive environment for code, visualization, and explanation.
- NumPy & Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
- PyTorch: Model definition, training, and evaluation.
- Torchtext/DataLoader: Efficient batch processing of text data.
- Scikit-learn: Calculation of classification metrics and confusion matrix.
- Hugging Face Datasets: Source for the labeled multiclass sentiment dataset.

# Conclusion 

This project successfully demonstrates the end-to-end process of developing a multiclass sentiment analysis model using natural language processing techniques and PyTorch. By preprocessing text data, engineering features, and implementing a neural network, the model is able to classify text into multiple sentiment categories with reasonable accuracy. The project highlights the practical challenges and solutions in text sentiment classification, such as handling imbalanced data and optimizing model parameters. Overall, it showcases the effectiveness of deep learning models in extracting and interpreting sentiment from textual data, serving as a solid foundation for further experimentation and real-world applications in sentiment analysis.
